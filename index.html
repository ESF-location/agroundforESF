        <h2>About this project</h2>
        <p>
          The European School of Frankfurt (ESF) is an EU‑accredited school in Frankfurt am Main that has outgrown its current site. 
          For many years, city and regional politics have been discussing where a new or expanded campus should be built. 
		  The German Federal Government, the State of Hessen and the City of Frankfurt are obliged to provide the ground for the ESF, as well as build the school, according to a <a href=https://www.un-ilibrary.org/content/books/9789210544092s002-c018/read> Treaty signed in 2022. </a>
		  A subsequent <a href=https://media.frag-den-staat.de/files/foi/525106/Verwaltungsvereinbarung_ESF_2001.pdf>German law</a> defined the split of responsibilities and costs between the Federal Government, the State of Hessen, the City of Frankfurt and the ECB.
        </p>
        <p>
          This page focuses on one single question: <strong>which location do local parties support for the future ESF campus?</strong> 
          It summarises public information on the political positions regarding different location options, as well as answers provided by political parties to my direct enquiries.

    <!-- LOCATION OPTIONS -->
    <section id="locations" class="section section-alt">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Location options under discussion</h2>
        <p>
          Several potential locations have been discussed in local politics and the media. The list below is not exhaustive, 
          but covers the main options mentioned in recent debates.
        </p>

        <div class="party-grid">
          <article class="party-card">
            <h3>Festplatz am Ratsweg (Ratswegkreisel)</h3>
            <p>
              One of the main options considered by the city for a new ESF building, located at the current fairground site used by the Dippemess funfair. 
              Technical and legal studies indicate that a school building would be feasible here, but it would affect existing uses such as the funfair and sports facilities.
            </p>
          </article>

				    <article class="party-card">
            <h3>Länderweg</h3>
            <p>
              The CDU party has recently proposed that an area, currently allocated to private gardens and part of the Frankfurt Green Belt, is reallocated to the ESF. 
			  The area is close to the S-bahn stop Mühlberg and at a short commuting distance from the ECB Main Building. The proposal is likely to be controversial because the Greens have opposed any decision affecting private gardens, and Ms Weber has been quoted arguing that she will oppose the selection of grounds that are privately owned and require financial outflows for the city of Frankfurt.

          <article class="party-card">
            <h3>New “Stadtteil der Quartiere” (North‑West)</h3>
            <p>
              A planned new residential district in the north‑west of Frankfurt, not far from the current ESF site in Niederursel. 
              Integrating the ESF into this new district could preserve school routes, but construction would start late in the decade, delaying the urgently needed expansion.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article class="party-card">
            <h3>Offenbach / Kaiserlei area</h3>
            <p>
              An alternative location on the Frankfurt–Offenbach border around the Kaiserlei junction. 
              This option would keep the school in the metropolitan area and might offer available land, but moving the ESF partly outside Frankfurt is politically sensitive.
            </p>
          </article>
        </div>

		
          <article class="party-card">
            <h3>Binding brewery </h3>
            <p>
              The Binding brewery closed in 2023, leaving ~6 hectares vacant near the Henninger Turm area; Radeberger had it assessed as viable for ESF needs, citing its central location and transport links. HOwever, the site would have to be purchased from private owners at market prices. Ms Weber has been quoted arguing that she will oppose the selection of grounds that are privately owned and require financial outflows for the city of Frankfurt.
            </p>
          </article>
        </div>


        <p>
          Other ideas and temporary solutions (e.g. container classrooms, extensions on the current campus) have also been discussed, 
          but this page focuses on the main long‑term location options.

          The table below summarises how different parties position themselves towards each location option, 
          based on public statements, council debates and media reports. 
          It uses a simple three‑step scale: “Support”, “Sceptical / conditions”, “Oppose / no clear support”.

        <h2>Methodology & Sources</h2>
        <p>
          Positions are summarised from answer to direct enquiries as well as publicly available documents such as:
        </p>
        <ul class="sources-list">
          <li>Party press releases and official statements about the ESF location.</li>
          <li>City of Frankfurt and Offenbach documents and council debates on the ESF site.</li>
          <li>Local media coverage (e.g. Frankfurter Rundschau, FAZ, Hessenschau) on the ESF location debate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Three parties have followed-up to my inquiries with public actions:
			        <ul class="sources-list">
          <li>FDP organised an event on 19 February to discuss the future of ESF. The position expressed in the event are reflected in the table above.</li>
          <li>CDU Frankfurt leader, Dr. Kößler, released a new proposal in an interview with FNP available here: https://www.fnp.de/frankfurt/cdu-schlaegt-laenderweg-statt-festplatz-fuer-europaeische-schule-vor-94176687.html#google_vignette.</li>
          <li>BFF raised a question in the last city council, criticising the delays and asking if Offenbach was a solution. FNP covered the matter in an article on 30 January. The article is not availabel online.</li>
        </ul>
			In addition, SDP education head, Ms Weber, released an interview with Frankfurt Rundschau explaining the SPD approach: https://www.fr.de/hessen/kommunalwahl-hessen-ere1519100/dezernentin-sylvia-weber-spd-spricht-ueber-den-standort-fuer-die-europaeische-schule-und-wehrt-sich-gegen-attacken-der-gruenen-94155054.html .
